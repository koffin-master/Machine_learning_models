Medical Expenses Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project uses Linear Regression to predict medical charges for non-smokers based on their age, BMI, and number of children.

The dataset is loaded from expenses.csv, filtered to only non-smokers, and a regression model is trained to estimate charges. The predictions are evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

⚙️ Workflow
	1.	Load Dataset
	•	Reads expenses.csv into a pandas DataFrame.
	•	Filters only non-smoker entries.
	2.	Custom Functions
	•	estimate_charges(age, W_age, bmi, W_bmi, children, W_children, b) → Estimates charges using manual weights.
	•	rmse(targets, predictions) → Computes RMSE loss.
	•	try_parameter(W_age, W_bmi, W_children, b) → Visualizes predicted vs actual charges.
	3.	Model Training
	•	Inputs: age, bmi, children
	•	Target: charges
	•	Model: Linear Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)
	•	Outputs: Learned weights W and intercept b.
	4.	Evaluation
	•	Prints coefficients and intercept.
	•	Prints RMSE loss.
	•	Shows scatter plots comparing estimates vs actual charges.

🚀 How to Run
	1.	Clone this repository.
	2.	Place the dataset expenses.csv in your project directory.
	3.	Run the script:
python medical_regression.py

📂 Dataset Format

The CSV file should have columns:
	•	age → Age of individual
	•	bmi → Body Mass Index
	•	children → Number of dependents
	•	smoker → Smoking status (yes/no)
	•	charges → Medical charges billed

⸻

📈 Example Output
	•	Learned weights W for features (age, bmi, children).
	•	Bias b (intercept).
	•	RMSE Loss showing model accuracy.
	•	Visual plot comparing predicted and actual charges.
