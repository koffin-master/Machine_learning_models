Medical Expenses Prediction

This project demonstrates a linear regression model to estimate medical charges based on patient features such as:
	•	Age
	•	BMI (Body Mass Index)
	•	Number of children
	•	Smoking status (filtered to non-smokers in this analysis)

The dataset is read from expenses.csv, and the model is trained using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression.

⸻

📊 Features of the Project
	•	Exploratory visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express
	•	Custom function to estimate charges using linear coefficients
	•	RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) implementation for evaluating prediction accuracy
	•	Training and testing of a Linear Regression model with multiple features
	•	Visualization of predictions vs. actual medical expenses

⸻

⚙️ Requirements

Install the dependencies using:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn scipy

🚀 How to Run
	1.	Clone this repository.
	2.	Place the dataset file expenses.csv in the project folder.
	3.	Run the script:
python medical_expenses_regression.py

📂 Dataset

The dataset expenses.csv should contain the following columns:
	•	age → Age of the individual
	•	bmi → Body Mass Index
	•	children → Number of children/dependents
	•	smoker → Smoking status (yes/no)
	•	charges → Medical charges billed

⸻

📈 Example Output
	•	Prints learned weights (W) and bias (b) of the linear regression model.
	•	Displays the RMSE Loss between predicted and actual values.
	•	Shows scatter plots comparing predictions vs. actual charges.
