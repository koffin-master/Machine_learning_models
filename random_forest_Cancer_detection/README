Breast Cancer Classification with Random Forest

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to classify tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer dataset.

The model is trained on numerical features, evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics, and feature importance analysis is performed to identify the top predictors of cancer diagnosis.

üì¶ Libraries Used

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
	1.	Data Loading & Cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Load dataset from bcancer.csv.
	‚Ä¢	Drop unnecessary column: Unnamed: 32.
	2.	Feature Selection
	‚Ä¢	Keep only numeric columns for model input.
	‚Ä¢	Target column: diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign).
	3.	Data Splitting
	‚Ä¢	Training: 70%
	‚Ä¢	Validation: 15%
	‚Ä¢	Test: 15%
	4.	Model Training
	‚Ä¢	Model: RandomForestClassifier (default parameters).
	‚Ä¢	Fit model on training data.
	5.	Feature Importance Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Extract feature importances from Random Forest.
	‚Ä¢	Display and plot Top 10 most important features.
	6.	Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	Predict on validation set.
	‚Ä¢	Print Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
	‚Ä¢	Confusion Matrix & Accuracy (if added).

üöÄ How to Run
	1.	Clone this repository.
	2.	Place the dataset file bcancer.csv in the project folder.
	3.	Run the script:
python breast_cancer_rf.py

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset bcancer.csv should include:
	‚Ä¢	ID and Unnamed: 32 (drop during preprocessing).
	‚Ä¢	diagnosis ‚Üí Target label (M = Malignant, B = Benign).
	‚Ä¢	30 numerical features such as:
	‚Ä¢	radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean	‚Ä¶ and more

‚∏ª

üìà Example Output
	‚Ä¢	Top 10 Features ranked by importance (e.g., radius_mean, perimeter_worst, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Classification Report with Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
	‚Ä¢	Bar chart showing most influential features.
